**Story:** Most teachers do a lot of Professional Development (PD) like webinars, self-paced courses and more. Getting evidence is often required for record keeping. Depedning on the event a certificate of attendance might be provided, often it's not. Which leads to I Was There, a quick and easy attendance certificate generator. No more screenshots of emails or making your own in word.
